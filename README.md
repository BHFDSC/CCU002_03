# COVID-19 vaccination and disease and the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis

## Project description

A few case series have reported a temporal association between the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines and myocarditis or myopericarditis. The patients affected were mostly males, younger than 50 years old and had an illness of chest pain associated with fever and with a rise in cardiac specific troponins that later fully recovered.  In some patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated typical findings of myocarditis.

Whilst this illness appears self-limiting, it is important to understand its frequency because these vaccines are currently the backbone of the COVID-19 vaccine control program in younger people.

In addition, it is important to clarify whether the risk of events seen after the second vaccination dose is similar or different to the risk after the first vaccination dose.

Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare conditions. We will conduct this study through analyses of linked healthcare data from the populations of England and Wales (total populations of around 57 million and 3 million respectively). The very large population size is needed to detect sufficient numbers of these rare health conditions for analyses to be statistically robust. In addition, the linked health data come from mutiple sources (e.g. primary care, secondary care, death registries, COVID testing and vaccination data), providing comprehensive information for defining the exposure of interest (vaccination), the outcome of interest (myocarditis or pericarditis), key characteristics of the population (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and other important comorbidities (e.g. prior COVID infection).
